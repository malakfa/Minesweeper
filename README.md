# Minesweeper Game

## Overview

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where players navigate through a grid of cells containing hidden mines. The objective is to reveal all safe cells without detonating any mines. Clicking on a mine results in losing the game. The game provides clues in the form of numbers indicating the number of neighboring cells containing mines.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a grid of cells.
- Some cells contain hidden mines. Clicking on a mine detonates it, resulting in losing the game.
- Clicking on a safe cell reveals a number indicating the number of neighboring cells containing mines.
- The player can flag potential mine locations by right-clicking on a cell.

## Example

In a 3x3 Minesweeper grid:


- The '1' values indicate that each of those cells has one neighboring cell that is a mine.
- The '0' values indicate that each of those cells has no neighboring mine.
- Using this information, a logical player can deduce that there must be a mine in the lower-right cell and no mine in the upper-left cell.

## How to Play

1. Left-click on a cell to reveal its content.
2. Right-click on a cell to flag it as a potential mine.
3. Continue revealing safe cells and flagging mines until all mines are flagged, or a mine is detonated.

## Dependencies

This project requires a graphical user interface (GUI) library to display the Minesweeper grid and handle user interactions. Common GUI libraries like Pygame, Tkinter, or Qt can be used for implementation.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
- Add a timer to track the duration of each game.
- Incorporate additional features such as custom grid sizes and themes.
